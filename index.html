<a id="monkeycam-v40" class="anchor" href="#monkeycam-v40" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>MonkeyCAM v4.0</h1>

<p>MonkeyCAM v4.0 is an open source CAD/CAM program for designing skis
and snowboards, and generating
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code">G-code</a> programs to cut board
parts with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control">CNC
machine</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design">CAD</a> portion
of MonkeyCAM is quite limited, and is specifically designed to aid the
design of skis and snowboards only. The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_manufacturing">CAM</a>
portion is slightly more general, but again is specialized to ski and
snowboard manufacture.</p>

<p>MonkeyCAM is published on Github at <a href="https://github.com/mikemag/MonkeyCAM">https://github.com/mikemag/MonkeyCAM</a></p>

<p>More information about ski and snowboard construction can be found at
<a href="http://www.happymonkeysnowboards.com/MonkeyWiki">Monkey Wiki</a> and

<p>At this time there are only Mac OSX binaries, sorry! <a href="https://github.com/mikemag/MonkeyCAM/issues/4">That will change soon</a>. </p>

<h2>
<a id="features-and-current-status" class="anchor" href="#features-and-current-status" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features and Current Status</h2>

<p>MonkeyCAM is currently a command-line program only. The program takes configuration files to
describe the ski or snowboard shape via a small set of parameters and
generates the following G-code programs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Base cutout</li>
<li>Core:

<ul>
<li>Guide holes to allow the core to be removed and flipped between programs</li>
<li>Alignment marks to transfer key design points to the bottom of the core</li>
<li>Edge relief to leave room for steel edges</li>
<li>Insert holes for standard snowboard inserts (T-nuts) in a variety of patterns</li>
<li>Top profile to impart the taper to the core</li>
<li>Cutout, allowing for sidewall overhang and nose/tail spacers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nose and tail spacers which match the core</li>
<li>Edge trenches to enable inlay of different edge wood and/or sidewall
material along the effective edge of the core</li>
</ul>

<p>The G-code programs emitted at this time have been tested on my CNC
machine with a very old DeskCNC controller and work correctly. Each
program also loads in Mach 3 and simulates correctly. The programs not
involving holes load in ShopBot's controller and simulate correctly,
but the ones with holes do not work for ShopBot right now.</p>

<p>There is no UI, and all configuration and results are in files.</p>

<p>You can see a sample set of programs here: <a href="http://www.happymonkeysnowboards.com/MonkeyCAM/path-viewer.html">MonkeyCAM Visualization
Example</a></p>

<a id="future-work" class="anchor" href="#future-work" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Future Work</h2>

<p>MonkeyCAM v4.0 is a work in-progress. It is an incomplete (~50% so
far) port of MonkeyCAM, developed by <a href="https://github.com/mikemag">Mike
Magruder</a> for <a href="http://www.happymonkeysnowboards.com/">Happy Monkey Snowboards,
Inc.</a> from 2003 to 2012. The
valuable parts of the MonkeyCAM v3 backend (shape and G-code
generation) will be ported to this version over the next many
months. The old UI will be discarded. The plan includes, roughly in
order:</p>

<ul>
<li>Target more G-code controllers with different formats and requirements.</li>
<li>Provide distribution of binaries for Mac OSX and Windows 8.</li>
<li>More options for effective edge, nose, and tail. (MonkeyCAM v3, for
instance, had 6 tail options.)</li>
<li>Port the code to soften the transition between edge and
nose/tail. (You can work around this with a sandblock and two min of
your time for now.)</li>
<li>Port the MonkeyCAM design UI to a web-based UI built on HTML 5, and
enable local execution.

<ul>
<li>The UI will include easy controls for inputting the shape
parameters, plus live visualization of the overall shape, profile,
insert placement, etc. It also includes specifying the machining
parameters. Right now I'm thinking about a combination of React and
three.js.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Port the MonkeyCAM G-code validation UI, built on the same framework
as the design UI.

<ul>
<li>This includes import of the G-code programs output from MonkeyCAM,
as well as pretty much any G-code program, visualization of the
tool path, overlay of multiple programs together for validation,
and stepping through G-code programs to better understand how the
cutter will move.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Host MonkeyCAM on servers in something like AWS or Google Apps;
serve the UI while running the engine on the server, provide local
storage for board configurations.</li>
<li>Read the overall board shape from other CAD programs (DXF at least).</li>
<li>Output the overall shape, insert locations, etc. to PDF/DXF for
printing or use in other CAD programs.</li>
<li>Mold design and program to cut molds.</li>
<li>Rouging passes for the core profile.</li>
<li>Adapt for other kinds of 'boards': kite boards, skate boards, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why not just open source MonkeyCAM v3? Honestly, the code for my
personal version of MonkeyCAM has grown rather organically over almost
10 years and three major revisions. It is a huge mess of C#, WinForms,
and Managed DirectX, and I'd really prefer no one but me ever sees
that code again. :)</p>

<h2>
<a id="dependencies" class="anchor" href="#dependencies" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dependencies</h2>

<p>MonkeyCAM currently depends on the following packages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Currently, builds on Mac OSX 10.9.4 Mavericks with the system compiler, Apple LLVM version 5.1 (clang-503.0.40) (based on LLVM 3.4svn).</li>
<li>CMake 3.0.0. See <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">http://www.cmake.org/</a> or install via something like Ports.</li>
<li>Boost 1.55.0. See <a href="http://www.boost.org/">http://www.boost.org/</a> or install via something like Ports.</li>
<li>Clipper 5.1.6. See
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/polyclipping/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/polyclipping/</a>. The CMake files
assume this is installed in a sibling directory with the top-level
MonkeyCAM directory, named clipper_ver5.1.6.</li>
<li>Up thru 953fe71b, GCC 4.8.1. See <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">http://gcc.gnu.org/</a> or install via
something like Ports. I'll ressurect the GCC build once I start
deploying on AWS.</li>
</ul>
