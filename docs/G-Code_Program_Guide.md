# MonkeyCAM v4.0 G-Code Program Guide

The G-Code programs generated by MonkeyCAM are designed to work
together to create the parts necessary to build a ski or
snowboard. This includes the core, base material, and nose/tail filler
material.

Each program is described below, in the order in which it should be
used.

See the [MonkeyCAM v4.0 User’s Guide](
https://github.com/mikemag/MonkeyCAM/blob/master/docs/Users_Guide.md)
for an overview.


## Guide Holes

The “Guide Holes” program creates two holes in the core blank, one at
each end of the core, centered on the long axis of the core. These
guide holes pass all the way thru the core and into the table surface
a short distance. These are used to allow you to remove the core from
the table and replace it accurately later, possibly flipping it over.

This program uses a straight cutter, typically 0.250”. I use 0.505”
guide holes with 2” long, 0.5” diameter steel pins to realign the
core, and I typically cut ~0.100” into the table.

Before removing the core, I write the core number in the hole with a
pencil so I know which of the many holes in my sacrificial table top I
should use later.

If you have an alternative, reliable way of realigning the core to the
table then you don’t need this program. Be sure that your method
allows you to flip the core over and align the center axis perfectly.


## Alignment Marks

The “Alignment Marks” program places small dimples in various places
over the base of the core blank to mark very useful points for use
after the core has been completely cut out. These mark the following:

* The long center axis of the board.
* The short center axis of the board.
* The center of the effective edge.

These allow you to transfer these guide lines to the base and mold
later.

This program also sinks two extra, deep alignment marks outside of the
core. These are for use in an emergency: if you crash your machine and
do not have accurate limit switches to re-home the machine, then you
can use these marks to very accurately re-home the machine manually.

This program uses a V-shaped cutter of any size, though I use a 0.25”
diameter cutter. Any cutter with a sharp point will do.
